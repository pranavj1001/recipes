Recipe for Veg Pasta

Step 1 
Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.

 Step 2 
Tear bread into small pieces, place on a baking tray and drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil. Bake for about 10 minutes until golden and crisp. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely. Place in a food processor with one-third of the garlic and 1/2 cup parsley. Pulse to form coarse crumbs, then set pangrattato aside.

 Step 3 
Cook pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water to packet instructions, adding broccolini for the final 1 minute of cooking time. Drain.

 Step 4 
Meanwhile, heat remaining oil in a large frypan over medium heat. Add chilli, zest and remaining garlic, then cook, stirring, for 30 seconds until fragrant. Add drained broccolini and pasta and toss to combine, then stir through remaining parsley and half the parmesan or vegetarian hard cheese.

 Step 5 
Divide pasta among warm bowls, then sprinkle with pangrattato and remaining parmesan or vegetarian hard cheese and serve with lemon wedges.
